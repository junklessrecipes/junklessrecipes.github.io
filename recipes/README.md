## Recipes

This is the folder where all of the recipes and resources are stored.

## How to add a recipe

First, read through `template.html` and figure out what to put where. Then, make a copy of `blank.html` and fill it in accordingly. Add any images/videos/etc. to the `res/` folder. **Remember: we do not need to hear your life story**. When your recipe is done, add a link to it on `../index.html`, following the instructions written in there. The most recently added recipe should be at the top, so just start typing under the info comment.
