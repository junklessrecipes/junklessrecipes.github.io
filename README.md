# Junkless Recipes

A website where you can find recipes, free of charge, without bloat, ads, trackers and the like. Like https://recipeasly.com/, but I won't back down.4

## How to add a recipe

First, make a copy of `template.html` in the `recipes` folder. Then, write your recipe, add your pictures, etc, where is is indicated. After that is done, add a link to your recipe to the homepage.
