# Junkless Recipes

A website where you can find recipes, free of charge, without bloat, ads, trackers and the like. No life stories, no crying about your dead grandmother for ten paragraphs, just food.

## How to add a recipe

First, read through `template.html` and figure out what to put where. Then, make a copy of `blank.html` and fill it in accordingly. Add any images/videos/etc. to the `res/` folder. **Remember: we do not need to hear your life story**.
